# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
This application is the solution for the individual who is hungry, yet indesiscive. On the left, there is a prompt that instructs the user to choose which category of food they want (sides, main dishes, desserts, or even a whole meal). Once the user selects their desired category and clicks the button below, they will be shown a random suggestion of what to eat.

### Installation Instructions:
Using the ssh key located on the project page, the user will clone the project to their local machine. This app can be viewed/used on a local machine via the html file.

### Preview of App:

### Learning Goals:
Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
Individualize your programming skill set

For this project, I met the learning goals of incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into the functionality of my application. With CSS and HTML, I also was able to stylistically match the given comp for this project. I am curious to see how my application of CSS matures in the future. I also used this project as an opportunity to write more readable code.

### Wins + Challenges:
I am proud of my minimal JavaScript code as well as my implementation of CSS. Being that this was my first solo project, I am very excited with the entire outcome. I struggled several times with different stylistic elements of the application, but ultimately learned a lot about the overall capabilities of CSS.
